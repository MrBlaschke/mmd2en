# {{{project}}} component library #

The documented components form the foundation of the *{{{project}}}* script and its derivatives (see the [{{{project}}} repository]({{{repo}}})). Their creation rationale was to be self contained rather than having to rely on gems which might or might not be installed on userâ€™s systems. As such, they will probably not be the best or most versatile solution for any problems outside the immediate scope of the project; if you need more extensive and / or versatile versions of the components of this library, you will find gems that do a better job.
