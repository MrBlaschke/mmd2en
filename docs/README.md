# MultiMarkdown → Evernote component library #

The documented components form the foundation of the *MultiMarkdown → Evernote* script and its derivatives (see the [MultiMarkdown → Evernote repository](https://github.com/kopischke/mmd2en)). Their creation rationale was to be self contained rather than having to rely on gems which might or might not be installed on user’s systems. As such, they will probably not be the best or most versatile solution for any problems outside the immediate scope of the project; if you need more extensive and / or versatile versions of the components of this library, you will find gems that do a better job.
